# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Use TypeScript for Backend

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need to choose a language for the backend service that balances developer productivity, performance, and alignment with company standards.

### Decision
Use TypeScript with Node.js for the backend service.

### Consequences
- ✅ Type safety reduces runtime errors
- ✅ Excellent tooling and IDE support
- ✅ Aligns with Ironclad's existing stack
- ✅ Large ecosystem of packages
- ❌ Slight build time overhead
- ❌ Learning curve for developers new to TypeScript

---

## ADR-002: PostgreSQL for Database

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need a reliable database that supports ACID transactions and complex constraints for storing user data.

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL as the primary database.

### Consequences
- ✅ ACID compliance ensures data integrity
- ✅ Rich constraint support (CHECK, UNIQUE, etc.)
- ✅ Excellent performance for OLTP workloads
- ✅ Native UUID support
- ❌ More resource intensive than MySQL
- ❌ Slightly more complex configuration

---

## ADR-003: Prometheus + Grafana for Monitoring

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need a monitoring solution that integrates well with Kubernetes and provides rich visualization capabilities.

### Decision
Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

### Consequences
- ✅ Native Kubernetes integration
- ✅ Pull-based model works well with dynamic infrastructure
- ✅ Rich query language (PromQL)
- ✅ Large ecosystem of exporters
- ❌ Requires additional infrastructure
- ❌ Learning curve for PromQL

## ADR-004: Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need to handle database failures gracefully without cascading failures throughout the system.

### Decision
Implement circuit breaker pattern for all database operations.

### Consequences
- ✅ Prevents cascade failures
- ✅ Gives failing services time to recover
- ✅ Better user experience during outages
- ✅ Easier to debug issues
- ❌ Additional complexity
- ❌ Need to tune thresholds

---

## ADR-005: Structured Logging with JSON

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need consistent, parseable logs for debugging and monitoring in a distributed system.

### Decision
Use structured JSON logging with correlation IDs.

### Consequences
- ✅ Easy to parse and analyze
- ✅ Consistent format across services
- ✅ Enables log aggregation and searching
- ✅ Correlation IDs help trace requests
- ❌ Slightly larger log sizes
- ❌ Less human-readable in development

---

## ADR-006: Chaos Engineering

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need to test system resilience and identify weaknesses before they cause production outages.

### Decision
Implement chaos engineering capabilities with controlled injection of failures.

### Consequences
- ✅ Proactive identification of weaknesses
- ✅ Builds confidence in system resilience
- ✅ Educational for the team
- ✅ Controlled testing environment
- ❌ Risk if not properly controlled
- ❌ Requires careful coordination

---

## ADR-007: SLO-Based Monitoring

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Need to align technical metrics with business objectives and manage reliability expectations.

### Decision
Implement SLO-based monitoring with error budgets.

### Consequences
- ✅ Clear reliability targets
- ✅ Balances innovation with stability
- ✅ Data-driven decision making
- ✅ Better communication with stakeholders
- ❌ Requires careful SLO definition
- ❌ Need to educate team on concepts
